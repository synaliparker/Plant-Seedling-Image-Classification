# Plant Seedling Image Classification

Completed for the UT Austin McCombs Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Post Graduate Program. 

**Course:** Introduction to Computer Vision - February 2021

**Score:** 57/60

## Project Summary
To identify the plant seedlings species from 12 different species using a convolutional neural network.

### Skills and Tools
Computer Vision, Keras, CNN

## Project Description

You are provided with a dataset of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its
unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's
species from a photo.

#### **Context:**
Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has
recently released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages

#### **Objective:**
- To implement the techniques learnt as a part of the course.

#### **Learning Outcomes:**
* Pre-processing of image data.
* Visualization of images.
* Building CNN.
* Evaluate the Model.
* The motive of the project is to make the learners capable to handle images/image classification problems, during this
process you should also be capable to handle real image files, not just limited to a numpy array of image pixels.
